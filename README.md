# currymatic
Robot to cook Indian curries. 

High level design

1. Pressure/Saute Chamber: This is the main cooking chamber whhich will heat the oil and pressure cook vegetables if required. [Electric pressure cooker](https://www.amazon.com/Instant-Pot-Bluetooth-Enabled-Multifunctional-Stainless/dp/B00N310CKG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1473219232&sr=8-1&keywords=electric+pressure+cooker+bluetooth) - This is closest product on Amazon
2. Automatic Stirrer: Stir vegetables/Curry to make sure they cook evenly and don't stick.

  * [KitchenAid](https://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KST4054OB-Tower-Accessory-Multi-Cooker/dp/B010S2NJHK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1473619920&sr=8-1&keywords=stir+tower) - Seems like a very good solution but we might need a non-stick pan for chamber for it
3. Spice/Oil/Water dispenser: Tricky design, detailed design given further.
  * Dispense spice in multiples of half tea-spoon (2.5 ml)
  * Dispense measured quantities of oil and water 
4. Cut vegetable dispenser: This step will be manual for now, we expect the user to chop vegetables and put them in the saute chamber at the right time


Currymatic will be operated from a Mobile App, so that user can feed a recipe and tune things according to their taste.
