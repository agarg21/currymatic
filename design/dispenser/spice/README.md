##Problem: Dispense the following 6 spices in multiple of 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) quantity

1. Cumin seeds
2. Mustard seeds
3. Turmeric powder
4. Red chilli powder
5. Salt
6. Chana/Rajma masala

###Design Ideas

Volume based dispensing:
- Rotating cavity
  * [Spice carousel](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00004VWIP/ref=sr_ph_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1473622135&sr=sr-1&keywords=spice+carousel) - Very good manual dispenser, used it myself
  * [Dash] (http://designed.mit.edu/gallery/data/2010/final/extras/orangeBrochure.pdf) - Good design, but very expensive
- Sliding cavity
  * [From youtube] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpfYX2utZXY)
- Augur
  * Works better for higher quantities of spices

Weight based dispensing:
- Dispense into a general dispensing spoon with feedback based control system

### Current Design
- Experiment with rotating cavity design first. It'll be easier to control with a servo motor. Searched few designs on thingverse, starting with [Coffee dispenser V2] (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:739261)
